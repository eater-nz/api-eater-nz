Hawker dishes commonly found at stalls on the streets of Kuala Lumpur are served with the same authentic aplomb here. The char kway teow is smoky from high heat, and the wantan mee (dry egg noodles) are best with barbecue pork (char siu) and wonton soup — a common Malaysian breakfast. You can also find a $7 kopitiam-style afternoon-tea set (2.30–5.30pm), featuring sticky-sweet pandan kaya — a fragrant coconut jam — spread over steamed bread. As a slew of new burger joints pop up around town, Burger Burger’s original offering still comes out on top. A recently extended menu includes six 'jazzy burgers', tacos, and new sides. The McFly with crispy chicken and cheese is well worth the guilt over the calories, and we also love the fish burger and… everything else, actually. Also at 3B York St, Newmarket, and 40 Hurtsmere Rd, Takapuna. Line-caught fish. Owner Jacky Lam comes from good stock; his mum, 'Aunty KK', owns popular restaurant KK Malaysian in Epsom, so he knows his food. The short menu at his new, minimalist venture includes smaller serves of KK-esque curry laksa, curry chicken with rice and several roti wraps — flavourful meat and crisp vegetables wrapped inside buttery, flaky roti. Cervantes Lim and wife Patricia took over Tree Cafe from Lim’s mum and continue to specialise in typical Taiwanese dishes such as beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup, prawn wonton and dumpling soups. A favourite among regular customers is a pork chop or pan-fried chicken leg on rice. Though Taiwanese food is based on Chinese cuisine, there is a predominance of soups and the dishes tend to be less oily, with clean, clear flavours. All rice dishes come with three vegetable side dishes, as is customary."

The couple’s short menu of oozy, drippy, free-farmed burgers makes for great hang-over reading; the $20 kimcheese burger with double patty and double cheese is hard to resist. Line-caught fish."

In true New York style, the pizzas here are big — they come in large (14-inch) or extra-large (18-inch) sizes. The bases are hand-stretched and just the right degree of chewy. As for the toppings, owner Chickalena Rose keeps them simple, and the meatballs and sausage are homemade to family recipes."

A respectful demeanour is rewarded with warm advice from the counter and a readiness to veganise almost everything. An assortment of puri and vada pav — a fiery potato patty in a soft bun — is compulsory. You can also walk the streets of South India with idli and dosa. Be sure to order freshly brewed masala tea — it’ll take time, but it’s the real deal."
