This is authentic food, cooked for the local Chinese community, including pork knuckles in a lightly spiced pork and fish soup, and braised beef, generous and meltingly tender in a rich broth, to which you add chilli oil pungent with fermented shrimp. Devour with a serving of steamed lettuce in bean curd chilli sauce and a strong milky tea — a hangover of British rule — to wash it down. Cash only."
